  ## Description [![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://lbesson.mit-license.org/)
  This application allows you to start a server on your local machine and then run this note taker app. You can create notes that will then be stored into a db.json file. Because they are store in the db.json file they will persist when the app is reloaded. You can delete the notes by clicking on the delete button and this will remove that object from the db file.
